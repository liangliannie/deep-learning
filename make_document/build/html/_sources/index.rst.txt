This is a Deep learning tutorial for building U-Net by using Pytorch
===================================================================================================

In fact, I have no ideas about deep learning until I started my internship in Siemens, Knoxville, and I learned 
a lot from my super nice manager! Great thanks to him(BILL)! Note, I am also a beginner in deep learning!

During my internship, we try to use deep learning to do image impainting, and since the performance of our project 
is still far away from what we want(medical images need very high accuracy) we currently stop working on this. However, I do not want to
forget what I have learned. I think this is a so great start for me to learn about deep learning and explore different kinds of networks, and
this makes me feel excited almost every day so I want to share this with you. 

In fact, a lot of my coworkers are also very interested in building or learning about deep learning while they think
deep learning is very hard to learn. Hence, I also write this tutorial for people who are in the field of medical imaging
or other who might want to build their own deep learning networks but they do not know how to start. To be honest, to select the most suitable parameters/models
is the most time consuming part of deep learning, but to start deep learning is far more simple than you thought!

Hence, lets begin with this to open your new world to the deep learning(AI)!

   First, we will try to install all the necessary packages for the deep learning, and it will be great if you have a GPU.

   And then, we will talk about how to precesss your data (so important)! 

   Third, a quick start with U-Net will lead you to the heart of deep learning.

   Finally, we will train our U-Net and use several visualizations to view our results.
